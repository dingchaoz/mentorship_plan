### Projects

[Text Classficiation with Naive Bayes](https://github.com/cs109/2015lab10)
In the mini-project, you'll learn the basics of text analysis using a subset of movie reviews from the rotten tomatoes database. You'll also use a fundamental technique in Bayesian inference, called Naive Bayes. 

[Amazon Product Recommendation System](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/)
The Amazon product review datasets contains product reviews and metadata from Amazon, including 142.8 million reviews. We can build a recommendation system using possible tools like [SparkML ALS](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/ml-collaborative-filtering.html)
