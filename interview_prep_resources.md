Actual questions in Machine Learning Design: 

Q1:How would you design a system to identify the best photographs in a set of photographs? Explain your choices and what is needed to accomplish this task.

Q2: You have two algo, A1 and A2 that can predict if an image is a best shot. How do you decide which one is better.

- ### SQL:

You are modeling a typical school:
●	The school has multiple classes (French, German, Math, …)
●	The school had multiple students (Jack, Jill, John, Jane,...)
●	A student may attend zero, one or more than one class
●	A class has zero, one or more students

Q1: List the commands to create the Schema in a SQL Database:

Q2: Write the SQL query that returns the number of each students in a class:

+--------------+--------------+
| French       |   12         |
| German       |   7          |
| Math         |   21         |
… 

Q3: Write the SQL query that list the names of all the students in a given class

Q4: The school is an online class with billions of students and millions of classes. Performance for the above queries is now slow - what can you do?


Q5: Would you recommend other changes at this scale?
