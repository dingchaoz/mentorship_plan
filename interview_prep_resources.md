- ### Project Interviews:
Write down examples of work experiences related to these topics to refresh your memory—you will need to recall specific examples to answer the questions well. When asked about a prior experience, make sure you tell a story. Being able to concisely and logically craft a story to detail your experiences is important. For example: ”the challenge was X, I did A, B, and C, and decided that the answer was Y.”

Of course, if you can highlight experiences having to do with data science, these questions present a great opportunity to showcase a unique accomplishment as a data scientist that you may not have discussed previously.

Here are examples of these sorts of questions/prompts:

  - Tell me about a challenge you have overcome while working on a group project.
  - What have you done in the past to make a client satisfied/happy?
  - What have you done in your previous job that you are really proud of?
  - Tell me about a time when you took initiative.
  - Tell me about a time when you had to overcome a dilemma.
  - Tell me about a time when you resolved a conflict.
  - Tell me about a time you failed and what you have learned from it.
  - Tell me about (a job on your resume). Why did you choose to do it and what do you like most about it?
  - When you encountered a tedious, boring task, how would you deal with it and motivate yourself to complete it?
  - What do you do when your personal life is running over into your work life?


- ### Machine Learning:

Actual questions in Machine Learning Design: 

Q1:How would you design a system to identify the best photographs in a set of photographs? Explain your choices and what is needed to accomplish this task.

Q2: You have two algo, A1 and A2 that can predict if an image is a best shot. How do you decide which one is better.

- ### SQL:

You are modeling a typical school:
●	The school has multiple classes (French, German, Math, …)
●	The school had multiple students (Jack, Jill, John, Jane,...)
●	A student may attend zero, one or more than one class
●	A class has zero, one or more students

Q1: List the commands to create the Schema in a SQL Database:

Q2: Write the SQL query that returns the number of each students in a class:

+--------------+--------------+
| French       |   12         |
| German       |   7          |
| Math         |   21         |
… 

Q3: Write the SQL query that list the names of all the students in a given class

Q4: The school is an online class with billions of students and millions of classes. Performance for the above queries is now slow - what can you do?


Q5: Would you recommend other changes at this scale?
